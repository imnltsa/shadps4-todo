# shadPS4 compatibility "to do" list

Dumb little list to make sure every game has their OS equivalent.

https://imnltsa.github.io/shadps4-todo/

Notes:
- Does not account for issues that are incorrectly named (ex. `CUSA11111 Game Name` or `CUSA11111 -Game Name`)
- Does not contain games that are not on the compatibility list already. Please look at [SerialStation](https://serialstation.com/) for games that aren't on this list and contribute them to the [compatibility list](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4-game-compatibility/issues).
- I used like, AI on this, at least for the beginning because AI sucks horribly and had to do a bunch of stuff manually anyway I hate AI I hate AI I HATE AI

Dump your games and test them all! <3
